##insted of calculating the inverse of the matrix whenever asked 
##calculate and store in the cache to return next time


## create list matric object that can
## get/set value of matrix
## get/set value of inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
	

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
